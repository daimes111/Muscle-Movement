# Muscle Movement
---------------

####The idea behind Muscle Movement is a place to go to learn about the different muscles of the body and some of the best ways to manipulate them. I would like to have a 3rd party API so that there will be information of how to stretch certain muscles and what workouts would go best with them.

####The Muscle Selector diagram was created by [Ryan M Poe] 
![](/images/Muscle%20Group%20Selector.png)

#####The plan was to select parts of the muscle and have it direct to a certain page of the APT with the information on that muscle.
![]()

#####This posed more difficult than expected when converting to run the code with React. 

####See the code before using React: 
![](/images/Muscle%20Fill.png)

####and the code after
![](/images/React%20Body%20Code.png)

###This code is what was used to give the fill capabilities with click features in CSS

####They way that the style function must be coded differently style = {{color:""}} vs style="color:none;" and class must be called by className
----------------

###Where to Start?

####Users are able to start at either the Index Page or the Sign Up page. I would like a user to view comments and have access to the muscle group selector without having to login. However, users will be redirected to the login page, if they do not have an account, before they are able to edit, delete, or create a comment.
